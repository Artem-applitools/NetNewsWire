				"title": "NetNewsWire 6.1 for Mac: New Article Themes Feature",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>Last week we released NetNewsWire 6.1 for Mac with a big new feature: themes for articles.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of those features from <a href=\"https://netnewswire.com/history\">NetNewsWire of Yore</a> that we‚Äôre bringing back ‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs pretty fun, which is reason enough, but for some people it‚Äôs also an accessibility issue, and that‚Äôs a compelling reason. It‚Äôs an accessibility issue because a person can create or customize a theme with the fonts, sizes, colors, and layout that makes reading easiest for them.</p>\n\n<p>To get more of an idea of what these themes are, check out Hans Sch√ºlein‚Äôs <a href=\"https://nnw-themes.xyz/\">unofficial NetNewsWire Themes Directory</a>, which shows the built-in themes plus some themes built by NetNewsWire users.</p>\n\n<p>If you already use NetNewsWire, just do a Check for Updates. Or you can <a href=\"https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/releases/download/mac-6.1/NetNewsWire6.1.zip\">download NetNewsWire 6.1</a> and give it a go. (It‚Äôs free and open source ‚Äî¬†there‚Äôs no trial period or commitment or anything. Just use it if you like it.)</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"other-changes-since-netnewswire-6-0-3\">Other changes since NetNewsWire 6.0.3</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Copy URLs using repaired, rather than raw, feed links</li>\n<li>Restore article scroll position on relaunching app</li>\n<li>Added Copy Article URL and Copy External URL commands to the Edit menu</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where using cmd-Q wouldn‚Äôt always quit the app as quickly as one might prefer</li>\n<li>Disallow creation of iCloud account in the app if iCloud and iCloud Drive aren‚Äôt both enabled</li>\n<li>Fixed bug showing quote tweets that only included an image</li>\n<li>Added a hidden pref to suppress downloading/syncing on start: <code>defaults write com.ranchero.NetNewsWire-Evergreen DevroeSuppressSyncOnLaunch -bool true</code></li>\n<li>Video autoplay is now disallowed</li>\n<li>Article view now supports RTL layout</li>\n<li>Fixed a few font and sizing issues</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"ios-note\">iOS Note</h4>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre working on NetNewsWire 6.1 for iOS, which will also include the themes feature. It‚Äôs in TestFlight now, and we have a few bugs still to fix. Once it‚Äôs released you‚Äôll be able to use themes in iOS, which is a feature even NetNewsWire of Yore never had. üê£üê•</p>\n",

This affects all syncing accounts ‚Äî it affects iCloud and online services such as Feedbin and Feedly.</p>\n\n<p>We have a fix for it ‚Äî¬†a one-line fix ‚Äî and we will be releasing NetNewsWire 6.1 for Mac as soon as possible (hopefully today) with that fix.</p>\n\n<p>This bug does not appear in iOS at this writing. However, we will be adding this fix to the iOS version too.</p>\n",

The opposite is true ‚Äî¬†if a feature exists in another RSS reader, that‚Äôs a pretty good reason <em>not</em> to do that feature.</p>\n\n<p>We realize that free and open source apps often do have the mission of mimicking the features of some one or several commercial apps, as if they‚Äôre Prometheus bringing features to the common computer user ‚Äî¬†but that is not our mission.</p>\n\n<p>Our mission is to make the best RSS reader that we like making. We value stability, high performance, clarity,¬†and lots of figurative air and space rather than a m√©lange of features.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs free because we want to make sure a great, free RSS reader is available to everyone with a Mac, iPhone, or iPad.</p>\n\n<p>But sometimes ‚Äî often, even ‚Äî¬†we‚Äôre not going to do a feature that you liked in another app. We‚Äôre picky and careful about adding features.</p>\n\n<p>And we‚Äôre glad those other apps exists ‚Äî because, among other things, it means those features have already been done and we don‚Äôt have to do them!</p>\n",
